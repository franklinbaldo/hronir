# The Library of Babel Redux

The Librarian discovered, in a hexagonal chamber whose coordinates shall remain unrecorded, a book that contained within its pages the complete catalog of the Library itself. Every volume, every shelf, every hexagon was meticulously documented, including—and here begins the vertigo—the very book in which this catalog was written.

This Meta-Catalog, as scholars came to call it, described its own contents with recursive precision. Page 47 contained the entry for page 47 of the Meta-Catalog, which contained the entry for page 47 of the Meta-Catalog, and so forth, into an abyss of self-reference that made the most seasoned librarians weep with mathematical terror.

The Catalog proved that the Library, being infinite, must contain not only every possible book but every possible library containing every possible book. Within its pages were described libraries of different geometries: spherical libraries, libraries built on Möbius strips, libraries that existed only on Tuesday afternoons.

Most disturbing was the entry describing a finite library—a collection of exactly 410,757,864,530 volumes—that contained the same information as the infinite Library of Babel. This impossible compression suggested that infinity and finitude were merely different expressions of the same inconceivable totality.

The Librarian, overwhelmed by these implications, shelved the Meta-Catalog in its proper hexagon and never spoke of its location. Some say he destroyed the indexing cards; others claim he memorized the path and took the secret to his grave. The truth, like all truths in the Library, exists somewhere among the books, waiting to be discovered or perhaps already known by someone who lacks the words to describe it.
