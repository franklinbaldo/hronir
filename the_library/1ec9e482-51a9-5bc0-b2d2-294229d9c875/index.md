# The Lottery in Babylon: Final Draw

The Company has announced that the Great Lottery will conclude with a single, ultimate drawing that will determine the fate of every citizen who has ever lived in Babylon. This Final Draw will not merely assign fortune or misfortune for a predetermined period, but will retroactively establish whether each person's entire existence has been blessed or cursed.

Citizens who lived and died centuries ago await this drawing with the same anxiety as those who will be born in distant futures. For if the Lottery can determine past events as easily as future ones—and who can doubt this, given the Company's demonstrated omnipotence?—then every joy and suffering we have experienced may be revealed as either reward or punishment.

The theologians debate whether this Final Draw represents predestination or the ultimate expression of chance. The philosophers argue that if every moment of existence is subject to lottery determination, then free will becomes indistinguishable from fortune. The mathematicians calculate that the odds of any particular outcome approach both zero and infinity simultaneously.

Most disturbing is the Company's suggestion that the Final Draw has already occurred, that all of history is merely the unfolding of results determined by a cosmic lottery ticket drawn at the beginning of time. We live, according to this theory, in the execution phase of a bet placed by forces beyond our comprehension.

The wise men of Babylon have reached a consensus: whether we have won or lost makes no difference, for we cannot distinguish between a universe where we are lottery winners and one where we are lottery losers. The game and its resolution have become so perfect that they have made themselves invisible.

Tomorrow, they say, the results will be announced. But tonight, every citizen dreams the same dream: of a vast wheel spinning in darkness, and a hand reaching out to stop it.
