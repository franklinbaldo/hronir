# The Cartographer's Paradox

In the Imperial Archives of Uqbar, there exists a map of such precision that it equals the territory it represents, scale one-to-one. The cartographer who conceived this impossibility was Ireneo Funes, grandson of the mnemonist, who inherited not only perfect memory but perfect vision.

The map, when unfolded, covers exactly the region it depicts. Citizens of the mapped territory find themselves walking upon their own representation, each step a double movement through reality and symbol. Children born within the boundaries of this cartographic marvel grow to adulthood never knowing whether they inhabit the world or its description.

Funes observed that the map, being indistinguishable from its territory, renders itself simultaneously essential and redundant. Navigation becomes impossible, for one cannot orient oneself using a map that is the very ground beneath one's feet. Yet the map's perfection makes it the most accurate representation ever achieved.

The Emperor, upon hearing of this marvel, decreed that all maps in the Empire should achieve such precision. The Guild of Cartographers protested that this would require infinite maps of infinite size, each territory disappearing beneath its own representation. The Emperor, wise in his madness, replied that invisible territories require no maps at all.

Thus began the Great Cartographic Paradox: a world where every place is mapped with perfect accuracy, and therefore no place can be found.
