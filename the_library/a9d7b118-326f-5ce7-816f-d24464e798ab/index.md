# The Garden of Forking Paths: Convergence

Dr. Yu Tsun's descendant, Professor Li Wei, discovered among her ancestor's papers a map of the labyrinth that Ts'ui Pên had built not in space but in time. The garden of forking paths was not a physical maze but a diagram of all possible futures, each path representing a different sequence of decisions and their consequences.

Li Wei realized that her ancestor's act of treachery—killing Dr. Albert to convey intelligence to Berlin—was not one choice among many, but the inevitable convergence point of all possible paths. In every timeline, regardless of prior decisions, Yu Tsun arrived at that fateful moment in the garden where past and future crystallized into a single, necessary action.

The labyrinth revealed its terrible symmetry: every fork in the path of time eventually rejoined the main route. Free will was not an illusion but a detour—all choices led to the same destinations, though by different routes. The act of choosing was real; the possibility of alternative outcomes was the illusion.

Li Wei traced the paths forward from her ancestor's moment of decision and discovered that all timelines converged again at her own present. Every possible version of history, regardless of the infinite variations in detail, had produced the same outcome: a world where she stood in her study, reading Ts'ui Pên's temporal map.

She understood then why her ancestor had seemed so calm in his confession. He had seen not just one future but all futures, and had recognized that every path through the garden led to the same clearing. Choice was the freedom to experience necessity as if it were possibility.

The map showed one more convergence point: a moment in the future when all forking paths would end, when the garden would achieve its purpose and collapse into a single, eternal instant containing every choice that had ever been made or ever could be made.
