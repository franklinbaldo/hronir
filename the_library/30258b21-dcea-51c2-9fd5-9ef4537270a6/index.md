# Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote: The Continuation

Following the publication of my essay on Pierre Menard's remarkable achievement, I received correspondence from his estate executor revealing the existence of additional fragments. Menard had not only recreated chapters nine and thirty-eight of the first part of Don Quixote, and a portion of chapter twenty-two, but had begun work on an even more ambitious project: the composition of Don Quixote Part III.

This continuation, written in Menard's characteristic twentieth-century style while maintaining perfect fidelity to Cervantes' seventeenth-century intention, presents Don Quixote encountering the published account of his own adventures. The Knight of the Woeful Countenance discovers that his deeds have been recorded by one Cide Hamete Benengeli and published by one Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra.

Menard's genius lies in making Don Quixote aware of his own fictionality without destroying the reality of his existence. The Knight argues with Sancho about the accuracy of Cervantes' portrayal, insisting that the author has misunderstood his true motives. "This Cervantes," Don Quixote declares, "writes as if chivalry were mere madness, when clearly madness is merely insufficient chivalry."

The fragment ends with Don Quixote deciding to seek out Cervantes to correct the record. He plans to dictate the true story of his adventures, unaware that this impulse to control his own narrative is itself part of the narrative that controls him. Menard achieves the impossible: a sequel that comments upon its own impossibility.

Most extraordinary is Menard's note in the margin: "Cervantes' Don Quixote is the story of a man who believes in stories. My Don Quixote is the story of a story that believes in a man." The distinction is subtle but infiniteâ€”the difference between reading about reality and reality reading about itself.

I have verified that every word of Menard's continuation appears, verbatim, in no existing text. Yet reading it, one has the undeniable sensation of encountering something that has always existed, waiting to be discovered rather than created.
