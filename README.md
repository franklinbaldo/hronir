# The Hr√∂nir Encyclopedia

> *"The true version will be the one that, upon being read, reveals itself as inevitable."*

The **Hr√∂nir Encyclopedia** is a computational literary project creating an infinitely branching, self-reflective narrative inspired by Jorge Luis Borges' **Tl√∂n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius**.

See `GLOSSARY.md` for how various Borgesian concepts map onto project structures.

In this encyclopedia, each new chapter (**Chapter n**) is not simply a continuation of the immediately preceding chapter but is generated from the entire narrative space formed by all previously written chapters (0 to n-1). Each new branch is a probabilistic synthesis of previous narrative paths, preserving thematic coherence, stylistic unity, and Borgesian philosophical concepts.

Among infinite possibilities, one version will ultimately prove itself authentic‚Äînot by external authority, but because it resonates most powerfully within the minds of its readers.

## üì¶ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/franklinbaldo/hronir
   cd hronir
   ```

2. **Install `uv` (Python package manager):**
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```
   (On Windows, you might need to download the binary from [astral.sh/uv](https://astral.sh/uv) or use WSL.)

3. **Set up Python version (optional but recommended):**
   If you don't have Python 3.12 (or the version specified in `.python-version`), `uv` can install it for you.
   Ensure `.python-version` exists with your desired Python version (e.g., `3.12`).

4. **Create virtual environment and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   uv sync --all-extras # Installs main and development dependencies
   ```

5. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env  # and add your GEMINI_API_KEY to .env
   ```

Dependencies are managed with `uv` using `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`. Core libraries include [**click**](https://palletsprojects.com/p/click/) for the CLI and [**pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data manipulation.

## üîÆ How It Works

The encyclopedia grows through four parallel processes:

- **Generation**: AI creates new chapter variants from the accumulated narrative space
- **Collaboration**: Human contributors submit chapter variants via GitHub pull requests
- **Selection**: Readers participate in literary duels between competing variants (AI and human)
- **Evolution**: Elo rankings determine the emerging canonical path through collective recognition

Unlike branching narratives where readers choose paths, here the paths choose themselves through collective literary recognition‚Äîthe most inevitable version naturally emerges from the infinite possibilities, whether born from artificial intelligence or human imagination.

## ü§ñ Daily Automated Generation

The encyclopedia writes itself through GitHub Actions workflows that run daily:

- **Morning Generation** (06:00 UTC): Analyzes the current narrative space and generates new chapter variants using Google's Gemini AI
- **Evening Synthesis** (18:00 UTC): Creates synthesis prompts from accumulated chapters and generates additional variants
- **Automatic Commits**: Each generated chapter is automatically committed to the repository with metadata about generation parameters

This creates a living document that grows organically, day by day, as if the encyclopedia is discovering itself rather than being written. The automation ensures continuous narrative expansion while maintaining the project's conceptual purity‚Äîthe text emerges through systematic process rather than conscious authorial intent.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/daily-generation.yml
name: Daily Chapter Generation
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * *'  # 06:00 UTC daily
    - cron: '0 18 * * *' # 18:00 UTC daily
```

## ü§ù Human Collaboration via GitHub

Human contributors can participate in the encyclopedia's evolution by submitting chapter variants through GitHub pull requests:

### Contributing a Chapter Variant

1. **Fork the repository** and create a branch for your contribution
2. **Write your chapter** as a Markdown file anywhere (e.g., `drafts/03_my_variant.md`)
3. **Store it** under `the_library/` using the CLI:
   ```bash
   uv run python -m hronir_encyclopedia.cli store drafts/03_my_variant.md --prev <previous_uuid>
   ```
4. **Follow Borgesian style guidelines** (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`)
5. **Submit a pull request** with your stored hr√∂n

### Review Process

- **Automated validation**: GitHub Actions verify format, position, and basic style compliance
- **Community review**: Contributors and maintainers review for thematic consistency with the narrative space
- **Integration**: Approved variants enter the Elo ranking system alongside AI-generated chapters

### Human vs. AI Competition

Human-authored and AI-generated variants compete on equal terms in the literary duels. Readers vote without knowing the origin‚Äîthe most inevitable version emerges regardless of whether it springs from human consciousness or artificial synthesis.

```bash
# Contributing via CLI
uv run python -m hronir_encyclopedia.cli validate --chapter drafts/03_my_variant.md
uv run python -m hronir_encyclopedia.cli store drafts/03_my_variant.md --prev <previous_uuid>
```

## üìñ Structure and Generation of Chapters

Every new chapter (**n**):

- Is synthesized by considering the entire narrative space of all previously generated chapters (`0` through `n-1`).
- Employs a sophisticated language model (LLM), guided by a carefully crafted **synthesis prompt** that encapsulates themes, motifs, characters, and ideas accumulated thus far.
- Can exist in multiple variants (e.g., `2_a`, `2_b`, `2_c`), each exploring different interpretations of the collective narrative space.

The narrative expands exponentially, creating a network of infinite possibilities:

```
Chapter 0: The Mirror of Enigmas (seed)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Chapter 1: The Garden of Forking Paths
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1_a: The Labyrinth of Time
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1_b: The Library of Sand
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 1_c: The Aleph of Memory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Chapter 2: The Lottery in Babylon
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2_a: The Map of the Empire
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 2_b: The Zahir of Dreams
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Chapter n: [infinite emerging possibilities]
```

## üß© The Mechanics of Narrative Possibility Space

Each new chapter (`n`) is created through:

1. **Semantic extraction**: Previous chapters (0 to n-1) are analyzed via semantic embeddings to extract themes, concepts, and stylistic markers.
2. **Prompt synthesis**: A unified prompt is formulated, combining these extracted narrative elements into a coherent instruction for the LLM.
3. **LLM Generation**: The model generates a chapter that logically and creatively integrates the accumulated narrative history, maintaining a consistent Borgesian tone and theme.

This process ensures each new chapter reflects not only isolated events but also echoes, reflections, and metaphorical nuances that have organically developed throughout the entire narrative journey.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Selecting the True Chapter

- Variants within the same chapter position compete through **paired reader evaluations** (literary duels).
- Results of these duels are recorded using an **Elo-based literary ranking system**, establishing a probabilistic hierarchy among competing versions.
- Over time, a dominant version emerges for each chapter position‚Äîthe "canonical Hr√∂nir"‚Äîacknowledged by readers as the authentic narrative branch through their collective experience.
- Winning chapters are copied into the `book/` folder, and each selection constrains the possibilities for subsequent chapters via updated forking paths.

Example Elo ranking for Chapter 2 variants:

| Chapter 2 | Elo  | Wins | Losses |
|-----------|------|------|--------|
| `2_c`     | 1580 | 14   | 4      |
| `2_a`     | 1512 | 10   | 8      |
| `2_b`     | 1465 | 7    | 11     |

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

Forking paths are stored in `forking_path/yu-tsun.csv`, named after the protagonist of *The Garden of Forking Paths*.


```
the_library/                       # Chapters stored by UUID
book/                              # Current canonical version
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 00_tlon_uqbar.md             # Seed chapter (position 0)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ book_index.json              # Canonical path index
forking_path/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ yu-tsun.csv                  # Narrative branches
ratings/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ position_002.csv             # Recorded votes per chapter position
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Quickstart CLI Usage

### Generate new chapters and cast a vote automatically:

```bash
uv run python -m hronir_encyclopedia.cli synthesize \
  --position 3 \
  --prev 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000 \

# View the current narrative tree (prints a simple list for now)
uv run python -m hronir_encyclopedia.cli tree

# Check Elo rankings for a specific position
uv run python -m hronir_encyclopedia.cli ranking --position 2

# Validate a human-contributed chapter
uv run python -m hronir_encyclopedia.cli validate --chapter drafts/03_my_variant.md

# Store chapter using UUID layout
uv run python -m hronir_encyclopedia.cli store drafts/03_my_variant.md --prev 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000

# Validate and repair stored chapters
uv run python -m hronir_encyclopedia.cli audit
# Each forking entry receives a deterministic UUID

# Remove invalid hr√∂nirs, forking paths or votes
uv run python -m hronir_encyclopedia.cli clean --git

# These commands load ratings and forking_path CSV files into a temporary
# SQLite database via SQLAlchemy. Changes are written back to CSV when the
# command finishes.

# Export the highest-ranked path as EPUB
uv run python -m hronir_encyclopedia.cli export --format epub --path canonical

# Submit a vote with proof of work
uv run python -m hronir_encyclopedia.cli vote \
  --position 1 \
  --voter 01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef \
  --winner 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000 --loser 765e4321-b98e-21d3-a654-024617417000
```

## üîè Proof-of-Work Voting

Voting requires proof that you expanded the narrative. First create hr√∂nirs with `store` and connect them via a new row in `forking_path/`. The resulting `fork_uuid` from that row is your voting identity. Use it with `vote` to choose a winner and loser. See [docs/proof_of_work_voting.md](docs/proof_of_work_voting.md) for details.

### Vote on a literary duel:

```bash
uv run python -m hronir_encyclopedia.cli vote \
  --position 3 \
  --voter 89abcdef-0123-4567-89ab-cdef01234567 \
  --winner 3_a --loser 3_b
```

## Development Setup

Ensure you have development dependencies installed:
```bash
uv sync --all-extras
```

Then, install and enable the pre-commit hook to automatically clean invalid hr√∂nirs and votes:
```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

### Troubleshooting Pre-commit Hooks

If you encounter issues when running `uv run pre-commit install`, such as errors related to `core.hooksPath`, or if the hooks don't seem to run automatically when you commit, you can use the `scripts/fix_hooks.sh` script to help diagnose and potentially resolve common problems.

To run it:
```bash
bash scripts/fix_hooks.sh
```
This script will:
- Check your local and global Git `core.hooksPath` configurations.
- Inform you of potential conflicts with `pre-commit`.
- Offer to unset a conflicting local `core.hooksPath` if found.
- Attempt to run `pre-commit install` again.
- Provide guidance if issues persist.

Make sure the script is executable:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/fix_hooks.sh
```

## üß≠ Philosophy of The Hr√∂nir Encyclopedia

> In Tl√∂n, duplicated objects (hr√∂nir) redefine reality through perception and repetition.
> In this encyclopedia, infinite narrative multiplication redefines literary truth, naturally selecting‚Äîthrough reading experience‚Äîthe inevitable version.

The Hr√∂nir Encyclopedia exists at the intersection of imagination and reality, possibility and inevitability, continually expanding within the reader's consciousness. Each generated variant‚Äîwhether born from artificial intelligence or human creativity‚Äîexists in a state of potential authenticity until collective recognition determines which version was always meant to be.

Just as the **Library of Babel** contains every possible book, the `the_library/` directory holds innumerable variants. Each branch's summary hash functions as an **Aleph**, a point that contains all other points. Some branches become a **Zahir**, monopolising attention, while a Funes-like audit log recalls every change. Our Git history unfolds like the **Book of Sand**, without a first or last page, and any author may himself be dreamed by another, echoing **The Circular Ruins**.

The project explores fundamental questions about literary truth: Is authenticity inherent in a text, or does it emerge through recognition? Can computational generation achieve the same inevitability as human inspiration? When human and artificial minds collaborate unknowingly, which produces the more "true" version? In the end, the readers themselves become the final arbiters of what feels most inevitable, regardless of its origin.
[^menard]: This approach echoes Borges' 'Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote' (1939), in which identical text gains new meaning through context.
