# The Hrönir Encyclopedia

> *"The true version will be the one that, upon being read, reveals itself as inevitable."*

The **Hrönir Encyclopedia** is a computational literary project creating an infinitely branching, self-reflective narrative inspired by Jorge Luis Borges' **Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius**.

See `GLOSSARY.md` for how various Borgesian concepts map onto project structures.

In this encyclopedia, each new chapter (**Chapter n**) is not simply a continuation of the immediately preceding chapter but is generated from the entire narrative space formed by all previously written chapters (0 to n-1). Each new branch is a probabilistic synthesis of previous narrative paths, preserving thematic coherence, stylistic unity, and Borgesian philosophical concepts.

Among infinite possibilities, one version will ultimately prove itself authentic—not by external authority, but because it resonates most powerfully within the minds of its readers.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/franklinbaldo/hronir
cd hronir
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file lists the core Python libraries used in the project,
such as [**click**](https://palletsprojects.com/p/click/) for the command-line
interface and [**pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for Elo ranking data
manipulation.

## 🔮 How It Works

The encyclopedia grows through four parallel processes:

- **Generation**: AI creates new chapter variants from the accumulated narrative space
- **Collaboration**: Human contributors submit chapter variants via GitHub pull requests
- **Selection**: Readers participate in literary duels between competing variants (AI and human)
- **Evolution**: Elo rankings determine the emerging canonical path through collective recognition

Unlike branching narratives where readers choose paths, here the paths choose themselves through collective literary recognition—the most inevitable version naturally emerges from the infinite possibilities, whether born from artificial intelligence or human imagination.

## 🤖 Daily Automated Generation

The encyclopedia writes itself through GitHub Actions workflows that run daily:

- **Morning Generation** (06:00 UTC): Analyzes the current narrative space and generates new chapter variants using Google's Gemini AI
- **Evening Synthesis** (18:00 UTC): Creates synthesis prompts from accumulated chapters and generates additional variants
- **Automatic Commits**: Each generated chapter is automatically committed to the repository with metadata about generation parameters

This creates a living document that grows organically, day by day, as if the encyclopedia is discovering itself rather than being written. The automation ensures continuous narrative expansion while maintaining the project's conceptual purity—the text emerges through systematic process rather than conscious authorial intent.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/daily-generation.yml
name: Daily Chapter Generation
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * *'  # 06:00 UTC daily
    - cron: '0 18 * * *' # 18:00 UTC daily
```

## 🤝 Human Collaboration via GitHub

Human contributors can participate in the encyclopedia's evolution by submitting chapter variants through GitHub pull requests:

### Contributing a Chapter Variant

1. **Fork the repository** and create a branch for your contribution
2. **Write your chapter** as a Markdown file anywhere (e.g., `drafts/03_my_variant.md`)
3. **Store it** under `the_library/` using the CLI:
   ```bash
   python -m hronir_encyclopedia.cli store drafts/03_my_variant.md --prev <previous_uuid>
   ```
4. **Follow Borgesian style guidelines** (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`)
5. **Submit a pull request** with your stored hrön

### Review Process

- **Automated validation**: GitHub Actions verify format, position, and basic style compliance
- **Community review**: Contributors and maintainers review for thematic consistency with the narrative space
- **Integration**: Approved variants enter the Elo ranking system alongside AI-generated chapters

### Human vs. AI Competition

Human-authored and AI-generated variants compete on equal terms in the literary duels. Readers vote without knowing the origin—the most inevitable version emerges regardless of whether it springs from human consciousness or artificial synthesis.

```bash
# Contributing via CLI
python -m hronir_encyclopedia.cli validate --chapter drafts/03_my_variant.md
python -m hronir_encyclopedia.cli store drafts/03_my_variant.md --prev <previous_uuid>
```

## 📖 Structure and Generation of Chapters

Every new chapter (**n**):

- Is synthesized by considering the entire narrative space of all previously generated chapters (`0` through `n-1`).
- Employs a sophisticated language model (LLM), guided by a carefully crafted **synthesis prompt** that encapsulates themes, motifs, characters, and ideas accumulated thus far.
- Can exist in multiple variants (e.g., `2_a`, `2_b`, `2_c`), each exploring different interpretations of the collective narrative space.

The narrative expands exponentially, creating a network of infinite possibilities:

```
Chapter 0: The Mirror of Enigmas (seed)
├── Chapter 1: The Garden of Forking Paths
│   ├── 1_a: The Labyrinth of Time
│   ├── 1_b: The Library of Sand
│   └── 1_c: The Aleph of Memory
├── Chapter 2: The Lottery in Babylon
│   ├── 2_a: The Map of the Empire
│   └── 2_b: The Zahir of Dreams
└── Chapter n: [infinite emerging possibilities]
```

## 🧩 The Mechanics of Narrative Possibility Space

Each new chapter (`n`) is created through:

1. **Semantic extraction**: Previous chapters (0 to n-1) are analyzed via semantic embeddings to extract themes, concepts, and stylistic markers.
2. **Prompt synthesis**: A unified prompt is formulated, combining these extracted narrative elements into a coherent instruction for the LLM.
3. **LLM Generation**: The model generates a chapter that logically and creatively integrates the accumulated narrative history, maintaining a consistent Borgesian tone and theme.

This process ensures each new chapter reflects not only isolated events but also echoes, reflections, and metaphorical nuances that have organically developed throughout the entire narrative journey.

## ⚔️ Selecting the True Chapter

- Variants within the same chapter position compete through **paired reader evaluations** (literary duels).
- Results of these duels are recorded using an **Elo-based literary ranking system**, establishing a probabilistic hierarchy among competing versions.
- Over time, a dominant version emerges for each chapter position—the "canonical Hrönir"—acknowledged by readers as the authentic narrative branch through their collective experience.
- Winning chapters are copied into the `book/` folder, and each selection constrains the possibilities for subsequent chapters via updated forking paths.

Example Elo ranking for Chapter 2 variants:

| Chapter 2 | Elo  | Wins | Losses |
|-----------|------|------|--------|
| `2_c`     | 1580 | 14   | 4      |
| `2_a`     | 1512 | 10   | 8      |
| `2_b`     | 1465 | 7    | 11     |

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

Forking paths are stored in `forking_path/yu-tsun.csv`, named after the protagonist of *The Garden of Forking Paths*.


```
the_library/                       # Chapters stored by UUID
book/                              # Current canonical version
├── 00_tlon_uqbar.md             # Seed chapter (position 0)
├── book_index.json              # Canonical path index

```

## 🔏 Proof-of-Work Voting

Each vote must present a new forking path accompanied by two undiscovered hrönirs. This ingenious proof-of-work not only protects the ranking system from frivolous votes, it actively expands the encyclopedia's universe. Votes are tallied immediately unless their forking path has the greatest **distance** in the graph. Distance equals the difference in path length from the current leader plus the path's ranking position. Paths with the maximum distance remain recorded but their votes do not affect the rankings.

For a deeper look at the rationale behind this system, see [docs/proof_of_work_voting.md](docs/proof_of_work_voting.md).

### Vote on a literary duel:

```bash
python -m hronir_encyclopedia.cli vote \
  --position 3 \
  --voter 89abcdef-0123-4567-89ab-cdef01234567 \
  --winner 3_a --loser 3_b
```

## Development Setup

Install and enable the pre-commit hook to automatically clean invalid hrönirs and votes:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

## 🧭 Philosophy of The Hrönir Encyclopedia

> In Tlön, duplicated objects (hrönir) redefine reality through perception and repetition.
> In this encyclopedia, infinite narrative multiplication redefines literary truth, naturally selecting—through reading experience—the inevitable version.

The Hrönir Encyclopedia exists at the intersection of imagination and reality, possibility and inevitability, continually expanding within the reader's consciousness. Each generated variant—whether born from artificial intelligence or human creativity—exists in a state of potential authenticity until collective recognition determines which version was always meant to be.

Just as the **Library of Babel** contains every possible book, the `the_library/` directory holds innumerable variants. Each branch's summary hash functions as an **Aleph**, a point that contains all other points. Some branches become a **Zahir**, monopolising attention, while a Funes-like audit log recalls every change. Our Git history unfolds like the **Book of Sand**, without a first or last page, and any author may himself be dreamed by another, echoing **The Circular Ruins**.

The project explores fundamental questions about literary truth: Is authenticity inherent in a text, or does it emerge through recognition? Can computational generation achieve the same inevitability as human inspiration? When human and artificial minds collaborate unknowingly, which produces the more "true" version? In the end, the readers themselves become the final arbiters of what feels most inevitable, regardless of its origin.
[^menard]: This approach echoes Borges' 'Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote' (1939), in which identical text gains new meaning through context.
