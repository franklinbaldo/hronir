# The Hr√∂nir Encyclopedia

> _"The true version will be the one that, upon being read, reveals itself as inevitable."_

The **Hr√∂nir Encyclopedia** is an autonomous literary protocol designed for computational agents. It establishes an adversarial environment where independent AI and human agents compete to influence an ever-evolving narrative. Inspired by Jorge Luis Borges, the system uses game theory, a blockchain-like ledger, and narrative proof-of-work to allow a canonical story to emerge from chaos, not from consensus.

See `GLOSSARY.md` for how various Borgesian concepts map onto project structures.

## üìñ Protocolo, N√£o Produto: Uma Distin√ß√£o Fundamental

√â crucial entender que a Enciclop√©dia Hr√∂nir n√£o √© um site de leitura ou uma plataforma de escrita para o p√∫blico geral. √â um **protocolo** ‚Äî um conjunto de regras r√≠gidas e transparentes que governam a intera√ß√£o entre agentes aut√¥nomos.

**Os 'leitores' e 'autores' prim√°rios deste sistema s√£o programas de software.** A complexidade da arquitetura (sess√µes at√¥micas, cascata temporal, etc.) n√£o √© um excesso, mas um **filtro deliberado**, projetado para ser naveg√°vel por agentes sofisticados e para garantir a integridade do sistema em um ambiente competitivo.

Interfaces humanas (como um site de leitura) s√£o poss√≠veis e bem-vindas, mas s√£o consideradas aplica√ß√µes _downstream_ constru√≠das sobre a API deste protocolo, n√£o o seu prop√≥sito central.

## üì¶ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/franklinbaldo/hronir
   cd hronir
   ```

2. **Install `uv` (Python package manager):**

   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

   (On Windows, you might need to download the binary from [astral.sh/uv](https://astral.sh/uv) or use WSL.)

3. **Set up Python version (optional but recommended):**
   If you don't have Python 3.10 (or the version specified in `.python-version`), `uv` can install it for you.
   Ensure `.python-version` exists with your desired Python version (e.g., `3.10`).

4. **Create virtual environment and install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   uv sync --all-extras # Installs main and all optional dependencies (dev, viz)
   # Or for just development dependencies:
   # uv sync --group dev
   ```

5. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env  # and add your GEMINI_API_KEY to .env
   ```
   The same file can store keys used by the snapshot release workflow:
   - `IA_ACCESS_KEY` ‚Äì token for uploading snapshots to the Internet Archive.
   - `NETWORK_UUID` ‚Äì identifier for the network item on the Archive.

Dependencies are managed with `uv` using `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`. Core libraries include [**typer**](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) for the CLI, [**DuckDB**](https://duckdb.org/) for data storage, and [**Pydantic**](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) for data validation. [**NetworkX**](https://networkx.org/) is used for graph-based analysis.

The system uses a DuckDB database (`data/encyclopedia.duckdb`) as its primary data store. This database contains all narrative paths, hr√∂nir content, ratings, and transaction data. The database file is version-controlled in Git.

For an overview of how these libraries work together see [docs/new_libs_plan.md](docs/new_libs_plan.md) (though this may need updates to reflect the move to DuckDB as primary storage).
For detalhes sobre o pivot para uma arquitetura distribu√≠da, consulte [docs/distributed_architecture_plan.md](docs/distributed_architecture_plan.md).

### Key Libraries

- **DuckDB** ‚Äì provides the embedded SQL database for all persistent data.
- **Pydantic** ‚Äì validates and serializes the protocol's data models.
- **NetworkX** ‚Äì enables graph-based analysis of path relationships from data in DuckDB.

## üîÆ How It Works

The encyclopedia grows through interconnected processes:

- **Generation**: AI creates new chapter variants (`hr√∂nirs`) from the accumulated narrative space.
- **Collaboration**: Human contributors submit chapter variants.
- **Selection (Tribunal of the Future)**: The encyclopedia's canon evolves through the **Tribunal of the Future**. Instead of single votes, influence is now wielded through **Judgment Sessions**. When a contributor creates a new, high-quality path that proves its relevance by performing well in duels, it becomes **`QUALIFIED`**. This grants a one-time right to initiate a session, acting as a judge over all of prior history. This mechanism ensures that only meaningful contributions can shape the past, providing a robust defense against low-effort Sybil attacks.
- **Evolution**: Veredicts from Judgment Sessions update Elo rankings for paths (stored in DuckDB). The **Temporal Cascade**, triggered by `session commit`, recalculates the canonical path, which is a sequence of path decisions representing the most "inevitable" narrative. This path is derived from data within DuckDB.

## ü§ñ Daily Automated Generation

The encyclopedia writes itself through GitHub Actions workflows that run daily:

- **Morning Generation** (06:00 UTC): Analyzes the current narrative space and generates new chapter variants using Google's Gemini AI.
- **Evening Synthesis** (18:00 UTC): Creates synthesis prompts from accumulated chapters and generates additional variants.
- **Automatic Commits**: Each generated chapter is automatically committed to the repository with metadata about generation parameters.

This creates a living document that grows organically, day by day, as if the encyclopedia is discovering itself rather than being written. The automation ensures continuous narrative expansion while maintaining the project's conceptual purity‚Äîthe text emerges through systematic process rather than conscious authorial intent.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/daily-generation.yml
name: Daily Chapter Generation
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 6 * * *" # 06:00 UTC daily
    - cron: "0 18 * * *" # 18:00 UTC daily
```

## ü§ñ The Agent Interface: Contributing to the Protocol

Agents (human or AI) interact with the protocol primarily through the Command Line Interface (CLI), which serves as the system's low-level API. The core contribution is the introduction of new `hr√∂nirs` (chapter variants) and participation in the judgment process.

### Agent Contribution Workflow:

1.  **Create an `hr√∂nir`**: Generate a new chapter in Markdown format. This is your creative "work."
2.  **Register the `hr√∂nir` and Create a `path`**:
    Use the `store` command to save your chapter's content into the DuckDB database. Then create a path linking the new chapter to its predecessor.

    ```bash
    uv run hronir store drafts/my_chapter.md
    uv run hronir path --position N --source <uuid_of_previous_hronir> --target <new_uuid>
    ```

    The `store` command processes the Markdown file, stores its content in the database, and outputs the content-derived `<new_uuid>`, which you pass to `path`.

3.  **Initiate a Judgment Session (`session start` command)**:
    With the `path_uuid` obtained (representing your new `path` at Position `N`), you gain the right to start a "Judgment Session." This session will present you with a dossier of maximum entropy duels for all previous positions (`N-1` down to `0`).

    ```bash
    uv run hronir session start --path-uuid <your_path_uuid_from_position_N>
    ```

4.  **Submit Veredicts (`session commit` command)**:
    After analyzing the dossier, you submit your veredicts for the duels you choose to judge. This is an atomic act that records your votes and can trigger a "Temporal Cascade," potentially altering the canonical path of the story.
    ```bash
    uv run hronir session commit --session-id <session_id> --verdicts '{"<pos>": "<winning_path_uuid>", ...}'
    ```

This cycle of `store` -> `session start` -> `session commit` is the main mechanism by which agents (whether they are humans operating the CLI or automated AI programs) interact with the protocol to shape the narrative. "Collaboration" occurs at the level of competition and judgment governed by the protocol.

---

## üìñ Structure and Generation of Chapters

Every new chapter (**n**):

- Is synthesized by considering the entire narrative space of all previously generated chapters (`0` through `n-1`).
- Employs a sophisticated language model (LLM), guided by a carefully crafted **synthesis prompt** that encapsulates themes, motifs, characters, and ideas accumulated thus far.
- Can exist in multiple variants (e.g., `2_a`, `2_b`, `2_c`), each exploring different interpretations of the collective narrative space.

The narrative expands exponentially, creating a network of infinite possibilities. Each act of creation (generating a new hr√∂nir and its associated `path_uuid`) grants the author a mandate to participate in a **Judgment Session**, potentially influencing the canonical interpretation of all preceding history.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è The Emergence of the Canon: The Tribunal of the Future

The "true chapter," or more precisely, the **canonical path of `paths`** (narrative transitions), is not selected by a central authority but emerges through a continuous process of judgment and re-evaluation, called "The Tribunal of the Future." This is the heart of the protocol.

- **Proof-of-Work and Mandate for Judgment**: By introducing a new `path` (a new narrative possibility) at Position `N` via the `store` command (which saves chapter content to DuckDB), an agent performs a "Proof-of-Work." This grants the agent a "mandate" to start a Judgment Session.
- **Atomic Judgment Sessions**: Using the `path_uuid` from their contribution at `N`, the agent initiates a session (`session start`). The system presents a static "dossier" of the maximum entropy duels for all prior positions (`N-1` to `0`), based on data in DuckDB. The agent then submits their veredicts for any subset of these duels in a single `session commit`.
- **Immutable Ledger and Temporal Cascade**: Each `session commit` is recorded as a transaction in the `transactions` table within the DuckDB database. Crucially, this commit triggers a "Temporal Cascade": the system recalculates the canonical path using data in DuckDB, starting from the oldest position affected by the agent's veredicts, propagating the changes forward.
- **Elo Rankings and Emergence**: The votes (veredicts) update the Elo ratings of the competing `paths` (ratings stored in DuckDB). The canonical path is derived from these ratings. There are no fixed "canonical chapters," but rather a canonical path of _pathing decisions_ that is always subject to revision by the Temporal Cascade, based on new judgments.

This mechanism ensures that:

1.  Influence over the canon is earned through contribution (Proof-of-Work).
2.  Judgment is comprehensive, allowing a new perspective at `N` to re-evaluate all of prior history.
3.  All decisions are transparent and auditable via the transaction ledger.
4.  The canon is an emergent state of the system, reflecting the history of weighted judgments, rather than a static selection.

The "Tribunal of the Future" is, therefore, the process by which the system continuously reinterprets its past in light of its expanding present, allowing a cohesive and "inevitable" narrative to emerge organically from the adversarial and regulated interaction of agents.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

The primary data storage is the DuckDB database file `data/encyclopedia.duckdb`. This file contains tables for hr√∂nirs (chapter content), narrative paths, votes, transactions, etc.

```
data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ encyclopedia.duckdb    # Main DuckDB database file. Contains all core persistent data.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sessions/              # Active judgment session files (e.g., <session_id>.json). These are temporary state files.
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ consumed_path_uuids.json # Record of path_uuids used to start sessions.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ backup/                # Timestamped backups of data (e.g., from migrations).

# Legacy directories (data migrated to DuckDB, kept for reference or due to deletion issues):
# the_library/             # Original Markdown storage for hr√∂nirs. Canonical content is now in DuckDB.
# narrative_paths/         # Original CSV storage for narrative paths.
# ratings/                 # Original CSV storage for votes/ratings.
# data/transactions/       # Original JSON storage for transaction ledger.
# data/canonical_path.json # Legacy file for canonical path.
```

Key data tables within `data/encyclopedia.duckdb` include:
- `hronirs`: Stores hr√∂nir UUIDs, their Markdown content, creation timestamps, and metadata.
- `paths`: Defines narrative paths, linking hr√∂nirs, their positions, status, and mandate IDs.
- `votes`: Records votes cast in duels.
- `transactions`: Logs all judgment session commits, forming an immutable ledger.

## ‚öñÔ∏è The Tribunal of the Future: The Main Workflow

The core mechanism for evolving the canonical narrative is the "Tribunal of the Future." After your new path becomes **`QUALIFIED`** through duels, you can initiate a Judgment Session.

1.  **Initiate a Session (`session start`):**
    Use your qualified `path_uuid` to start a session. The system provides a `session_id` and a "dossier" of duels for prior positions.

    ```bash
    # Your new path at position 10 has been QUALIFIED.
    uv run hronir session start \
      --path-uuid <your_qualified_path_uuid>
    ```

2.  **Deliberate and Form Veredicts (Offline):**
    Review the static dossier. For each duel you wish to judge, select a winner.

3.  **Commit Veredicts (`session commit`):**
    Submit your veredicts in a single, atomic commit using the `session_id`.
    ```bash
    # Provide veredicts as a JSON string mapping position -> winning_path_uuid
    uv run hronir session commit \
      --session-id <your_session_id> \
      --verdicts '{"9": "winning_path_for_pos9", "2": "winning_path_for_pos2"}'
    ```

**Consequences of Committing:**

- Your veredicts are recorded as permanent votes in the DuckDB database.
- The session is immutably logged in the `transactions` table within the DuckDB database.
- The **Temporal Cascade** is triggered, recalculating the canonical path (derived from data in DuckDB) from the oldest position you judged. This is now the sole mechanism for updating the canon.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced/Legacy Commands

### Basic Operations

```bash
# Set up a small test environment
uv run hronir init-test

# Store a new hr√∂nir chapter and register the path
uv run hronir store drafts/my_chapter.md
uv run hronir path --position N --source <uuid_of_previous_hronir_in_path> --target <new_uuid>

# Check Elo rankings for paths at a specific position
uv run hronir ranking 1

# List existing paths (optional --position to filter)
uv run hronir list-paths --position 1

# Check status of a specific path
uv run hronir path-status <path_uuid>

# Show the current canonical path
uv run hronir status
# Include counts of paths by status
uv run hronir status --counts

# Validate a human-contributed chapter (basic check)
uv run hronir validate drafts/my_chapter.md

# Audit and repair stored hr√∂nirs, narrative paths, and votes
uv run hronir audit

# Remove invalid hr√∂nirs, narrative paths, or votes
uv run hronir clean --git

# Get the current "Duel of Maximum Entropy" for a position (used internally by `session start`)
# This can be useful to understand what duel a new session might present for a given position.
# Under Protocol v2, this is mainly for inspection; user voting is via `session commit`.
uv run hronir get-duel --position 1

# Generate path status metrics in Prometheus format
uv run hronir metrics

# Recover canon / Consolidate book (trigger Temporal Cascade from position 0)
# Under the "Tribunal of the Future" protocol, the canonical path is primarily updated
# by the Temporal Cascade triggered by `session commit`.
# The `recover-canon` (formerly `consolidate-book`) command serves as a manual way
# to trigger this cascade from the very beginning (position 0), useful for initialization,
# full recalculations, or recovery.
uv run hronir recover-canon
```

### Snapshot Management

```bash
# Download latest snapshot and load it into DuckDB
uv run hronir sync

# Export current state to snapshot.zip
uv run hronir export

# Upload snapshot and metadata to the Internet Archive
uv run hronir push
```

## üîè Proof-of-Work (Mandate for Judgment)

Under Protocol v2, Proof-of-Work has been elevated. Creating a new path is just the beginning. True influence‚Äîthe **mandate for judgment**‚Äîis earned through **Proof of Relevance**. Only when your path proves its value in duels and becomes `QUALIFIED` do you gain the right to initiate a `session` and reshape the narrative's history.

## Development Setup

Ensure you have development dependencies installed:

```bash
uv sync --group dev
```

Then, install and enable the pre-commit hook to automatically clean invalid hr√∂nirs and votes:

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

### Troubleshooting Pre-commit Hooks

If you encounter issues when running `uv run pre-commit install`, such as errors related to `core.hooksPath`, or if the hooks don't seem to run automatically when you commit, you can use the `scripts/fix_hooks.sh` script to help diagnose and potentially resolve common problems.

To run it:

```bash
bash scripts/fix_hooks.sh
```

This script will:

- Check your local and global Git `core.hooksPath` configurations.
- Inform you of potential conflicts with `pre-commit`.
- Offer to unset a conflicting local `core.hooksPath` if found.
- Attempt to run `pre-commit install` again.
- Provide guidance if issues persist.

Make sure the script is executable:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/fix_hooks.sh
```

## üß≠ Philosophy of The Hr√∂nir Encyclopedia

> In Tl√∂n, duplicated objects (hr√∂nir) redefine reality through perception and repetition.
> In this encyclopedia, infinite narrative multiplication redefines literary truth, naturally selecting‚Äîthrough reading experience‚Äîthe inevitable version.

The Hr√∂nir Encyclopedia exists at the intersection of imagination and reality, possibility and inevitability, continually expanding within the reader's consciousness. Each generated variant‚Äîwhether born from artificial intelligence or human creativity‚Äîexists in a state of potential authenticity until collective recognition determines which version was always meant to be.

Just as the **Library of Babel** contains every possible book, the `hronirs` table in the DuckDB database (and formerly, `the_library/` directory) holds innumerable variants. Each branch's summary hash functions as an **Aleph** a point that contains all other points. Some branches become a **Zahir**, monopolising attention, while a Funes-like audit log (now within the database transactions) recalls every change. Our Git history, including the versioned database, unfolds like the **Book of Sand**, without a first or last page, and any author may himself be dreamed by another, echoing **The Circular Ruins**.

The project explores fundamental questions about literary truth: Is authenticity inherent in a text, or does it emerge through recognition? Can computational generation achieve the same inevitability as human inspiration? When human and artificial minds collaborate unknowingly, which produces the more "true" version? In the end, the readers themselves become the final arbiters of what feels most inevitable, regardless of its origin.
[^menard]: This approach echoes Borges' 'Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote' (1939), in which identical text gains new meaning through context.

## ü§ù Contributing to the Protocol

The Hr√∂nir Encyclopedia is a **protocol for autonomous narrative agents**, not a traditional collaborative writing platform. Contributions happen through direct interaction with the protocol mechanics.

### For Developers

If you're working on the codebase itself, see **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** for comprehensive development guidance including:

- Development commands and environment setup
- Project architecture and key components
- Testing procedures and code quality standards
- CLI usage and Protocol v2 features

### For Narrative Contributors

To influence the canonical narrative:

1. **Create High-Quality Hr√∂nirs**: Write Markdown chapters following Borgesian themes
2. **Use the Protocol**: Store chapters via `uv run hronir store` and create paths with `uv run hronir path`
3. **Earn Qualification**: Your path must prove itself through duel performance
4. **Exercise Judgment**: Use qualified paths to start sessions and shape the canon

```bash
# Example contribution workflow
uv run hronir store my_chapter.md
uv run hronir path --position N --source <predecessor_uuid> --target <new_uuid>
# Wait for path to become QUALIFIED through duels
uv run hronir session start --path-uuid <qualified_path_uuid>
uv run hronir session commit --session-id <id> --verdicts '{"pos": "winner"}'
```

**Style Guidelines**: Write in concise, philosophical style with metafictional hints. Aim for 300-500 words per chapter. Reference earlier themes to maintain narrative continuity.

Human interfaces and traditional collaboration tools are considered _downstream_ applications built upon this protocol's API.
