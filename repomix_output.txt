# File Summary

## Purpose:

This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

## File Format:

The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Repository structure
4. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
   a. A header with the file path (## File: path/to/file)
   b. The full contents of the file in a code block

## Usage Guidelines:

- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

## Notes:

- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's
  configuration.
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to
  the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including
  binary files.

# The Hrönir Encyclopedia

> *“The true version will be the one that, upon being read, reveals itself as inevitable.”*

The **Hrönir Encyclopedia** is a computational literary project creating an infinitely branching, self-reflective narrative inspired by Jorge Luis Borges' **Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius**.

In this encyclopedia, each new chapter (**Chapter n**) is not simply a continuation of the immediately preceding chapter but is generated from the entire narrative space formed by all previously written chapters (0 to n-1). Each new branch is a probabilistic synthesis of previous narrative paths, preserving thematic coherence, stylistic unity, and Borgesian philosophical concepts.

Among infinite possibilities, one version will ultimately prove itself authentic—not by external authority, but because it resonates most powerfully within the minds of its readers.

---

## 📖 Structure and Generation of Chapters

Every new chapter (**n**):

- Is synthesized by considering the entire narrative space of all previously generated chapters (`0` through `n-1`).
- Employs a sophisticated language model (LLM), guided by a carefully crafted **synthesis prompt** that encapsulates themes, motifs, characters, and ideas accumulated thus far.
- Can exist in multiple variants (e.g., `2_a`, `2_b`, `2_c`), each exploring different interpretations of the collective narrative space.

The narrative expands exponentially, creating a network of infinite possibilities:

Chapter 0: Tlön, Uqbar… (seed summary) ├── Chapter 1_a, 1_b, 1_c … ├── Chapter 2_a, 2_b, 2_c … (synthesis from prior narrative space) └── Chapter n … (continuously broadening possibilities)

---

## 🧩 The Mechanics of Narrative Possibility Space

Each new chapter (`n`) is created through:

1. **Semantic extraction**: Previous chapters (0 to n-1) are analyzed via semantic embeddings to extract themes, concepts, and stylistic markers.
2. **Prompt synthesis**: A unified prompt is formulated, combining these extracted narrative elements into a coherent instruction for the LLM.
3. **LLM Generation**: The model generates a chapter that logically and creatively integrates the accumulated narrative history, maintaining a consistent Borgesian tone and theme.

This process ensures each new chapter reflects not only isolated events but also echoes, reflections, and metaphorical nuances that have organically developed throughout the entire narrative journey.

---

## ⚔️ Selecting the True Chapter

- Variants within the same chapter position compete through **paired reader evaluations** (literary duels).
- Results of these duels are recorded using an **Elo-based literary ranking system**, establishing a probabilistic hierarchy among competing versions.
- Over time, a dominant version emerges for each chapter position—the "canonical Hrönir"—acknowledged by readers as the authentic narrative branch through their collective experience.

Example Elo ranking for Chapter 2 variants:

| Chapter 2 | Elo  | Wins | Losses |
|-----------|------|------|--------|
| `2_c`     | 1580 | 14   | 4      |
| `2_a`     | 1512 | 10   | 8      |
| `2_b`     | 1465 | 7    | 11     |

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

book/ ├── 00_tlon_uqbar.md             # Seed chapter (position 0) ├── 01/ │   ├── 01_a.md │   └── 01_b.md ├── 02/ │   ├── 02_a.md │   └── 02_b.md ├── book_index.json              # Detailed narrative tree ratings/ └── position_002.csv             # Elo ratings per chapter position

---

## ⚙️ Quickstart CLI Usage

### Generate a new chapter (e.g., Chapter 3 from previous narrative space):

```bash
python -m hronir_encyclopedia.cli synthesize --position 3 --variant_id 3_a

Vote on a literary duel:

curl -X POST /vote \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "position": 3, "winner": "3_a", "loser": "3_b" }'

🧭 Philosophy of The Hrönir Encyclopedia

> In Tlön, duplicated objects (hrönir) redefine reality through perception and repetition.
In this encyclopedia, infinite narrative multiplication redefines literary truth, naturally selecting—through reading experience—the inevitable version.



The Hrönir Encyclopedia exists at the intersection of imagination and reality, possibility and inevitability, continually expanding within the reader's consciousness.

## File & Folder Naming Conventions

1.  **Chapter folders** use a zero-padded integer (`int16`) so that alphabetical order = chronological order.
    *   E.g. `00000/`, `00001/`, … up to `65535/`.
2.  Within each folder, filenames start with `UUIDv5(<raw-text-content>)` (hex form, lowercase), a hyphen, then an optional “slug” or suffix.
    *   Example:
        ```
        book/00000/0ce2f7b3-cd4a-5e92-b3e1-2b1f4d123456-base.md
        book/00000/9b52de11-1c8f-5a66-8e7d-4c3f8a789abc-alt-temp0.8.md
        ```
    *   This ensures:
        1.  Deterministic deduplication (same text → same filename).
        2.  Human-readable hints after the UUID (e.g. `-temp0.8` or `-alice.patch`).
3.  **Metadata lives inside each file** (YAML front-matter at top).
    *   Always embed the UUID, parent UUID(s), model name, temperature, timestamp, etc.
    *   The UUID in front-matter must match the filename’s UUID.
4.  Helper scripts will handle all padding, hashing, and front-matter injection—never rename files manually.

### Troubleshooting

If two files have identical UUIDs but different text, the helper must error out.

Changing any character (even whitespace) changes the hash and hence the filename.

# The Hrönir Encyclopedia

> *“The true version will be the one that, upon being read, reveals itself as inevitable.”*

The **Hrönir Encyclopedia** is a computational literary project creating an infinitely branching, self-reflective narrative inspired by Jorge Luis Borges' **Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius**.

In this encyclopedia, each new chapter (**Chapter n**) is not simply a continuation of the immediately preceding chapter but is generated from the entire narrative space formed by all previously written chapters (0 to n-1). Each new branch is a probabilistic synthesis of previous narrative paths, preserving thematic coherence, stylistic unity, and Borgesian philosophical concepts.

Among infinite possibilities, one version will ultimately prove itself authentic—not by external authority, but because it resonates most powerfully within the minds of its readers.

---

## 📖 Structure and Generation of Chapters

Every new chapter (**n**):

- Is synthesized by considering the entire narrative space of all previously generated chapters (`0` through `n-1`).
- Employs a sophisticated language model (LLM), guided by a carefully crafted **synthesis prompt** that encapsulates themes, motifs, characters, and ideas accumulated thus far.
- Can exist in multiple variants (e.g., `2_a`, `2_b`, `2_c`), each exploring different interpretations of the collective narrative space.

The narrative expands exponentially, creating a network of infinite possibilities:

Chapter 0: Tlön, Uqbar… (seed summary) ├── Chapter 1_a, 1_b, 1_c … ├── Chapter 2_a, 2_b, 2_c … (synthesis from prior narrative space) └── Chapter n … (continuously broadening possibilities)

---

## 🧩 The Mechanics of Narrative Possibility Space

Each new chapter (`n`) is created through:

1. **Semantic extraction**: Previous chapters (0 to n-1) are analyzed via semantic embeddings to extract themes, concepts, and stylistic markers.
2. **Prompt synthesis**: A unified prompt is formulated, combining these extracted narrative elements into a coherent instruction for the LLM.
3. **LLM Generation**: The model generates a chapter that logically and creatively integrates the accumulated narrative history, maintaining a consistent Borgesian tone and theme.

This process ensures each new chapter reflects not only isolated events but also echoes, reflections, and metaphorical nuances that have organically developed throughout the entire narrative journey.

---

## ⚔️ Selecting the True Chapter

- Variants within the same chapter position compete through **paired reader evaluations** (literary duels).
- Results of these duels are recorded using an **Elo-based literary ranking system**, establishing a probabilistic hierarchy among competing versions.
- Over time, a dominant version emerges for each chapter position—the "canonical Hrönir"—acknowledged by readers as the authentic narrative branch through their collective experience.

Example Elo ranking for Chapter 2 variants:

| Chapter 2 | Elo  | Wins | Losses |
|-----------|------|------|--------|
| `2_c`     | 1580 | 14   | 4      |
| `2_a`     | 1512 | 10   | 8      |
| `2_b`     | 1465 | 7    | 11     |

🧭 Philosophy of The Hrönir Encyclopedia

> In Tlön, duplicated objects (hrönir) redefine reality through perception and repetition.
In this encyclopedia, infinite narrative multiplication redefines literary truth, naturally selecting—through reading experience—the inevitable version.



The Hrönir Encyclopedia exists at the intersection of imagination and reality, possibility and inevitability, continually expanding within the reader's consciousness.

## File & Folder Naming Conventions

1.  **Chapter folders** use a zero-padded integer (`int16`) so that alphabetical order = chronological order.
    *   E.g. `00000/`, `00001/`, … up to `65535/`.
2.  Within each folder, filenames start with `UUIDv5(<raw-text-content>)` (hex form, lowercase), a hyphen, then an optional “slug” or suffix.
    *   Example:
        ```
        book/00000/0ce2f7b3-cd4a-5e92-b3e1-2b1f4d123456-base.md
        book/00000/9b52de11-1c8f-5a66-8e7d-4c3f8a789abc-alt-temp0.8.md
        ```
    *   This ensures:
        1.  Deterministic deduplication (same text → same filename).
        2.  Human-readable hints after the UUID (e.g. `-temp0.8` or `-alice.patch`).
3.  **Metadata lives inside each file** (YAML front-matter at top).
    *   Always embed the UUID, parent UUID(s), model name, temperature, timestamp, etc.
    *   The UUID in front-matter must match the filename’s UUID.
4.  Helper scripts will handle all padding, hashing, and front-matter injection—never rename files manually.

### Troubleshooting

If two files have identical UUIDs but different text, the helper must error out.

Changing any character (even whitespace) changes the hash and hence the filename.

# The Hrönir Encyclopedia

> *“The true version will be the one that, upon being read, reveals itself as inevitable.”*

The **Hrönir Encyclopedia** is a computational literary project creating an infinitely branching, self-reflective narrative inspired by Jorge Luis Borges' **Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius**.

In this encyclopedia, each new chapter (**Chapter n**) is not simply a continuation of the immediately preceding chapter but is generated from the entire narrative space formed by all previously written chapters (0 to n-1). Each new branch is a probabilistic synthesis of previous narrative paths, preserving thematic coherence, stylistic unity, and Borgesian philosophical concepts.

Among infinite possibilities, one version will ultimately prove itself authentic—not by external authority, but because it resonates most powerfully within the minds of its readers.

---

## 📖 Structure and Generation of Chapters

Every new chapter (**n**):

- Is synthesized by considering the entire narrative space of all previously generated chapters (`0` through `n-1`).
- Employs a sophisticated language model (LLM), guided by a carefully crafted **synthesis prompt** that encapsulates themes, motifs, characters, and ideas accumulated thus far.
- Can exist in multiple variants (e.g., `2_a`, `2_b`, `2_c`), each exploring different interpretations of the collective narrative space.

The narrative expands exponentially, creating a network of infinite possibilities:

Chapter 0: Tlön, Uqbar… (seed summary) ├── Chapter 1_a, 1_b, 1_c … ├── Chapter 2_a, 2_b, 2_c … (synthesis from prior narrative space) └── Chapter n … (continuously broadening possibilities)

---

## 🧩 The Mechanics of Narrative Possibility Space

Each new chapter (`n`) is created through:

1. **Semantic extraction**: Previous chapters (0 to n-1) are analyzed via semantic embeddings to extract themes, concepts, and stylistic markers.
2. **Prompt synthesis**: A unified prompt is formulated, combining these extracted narrative elements into a coherent instruction for the LLM.
3. **LLM Generation**: The model generates a chapter that logically and creatively integrates the accumulated narrative history, maintaining a consistent Borgesian tone and theme.

This process ensures each new chapter reflects not only isolated events but also echoes, reflections, and metaphorical nuances that have organically developed throughout the entire narrative journey.

---

## ⚔️ Selecting the True Chapter

- Variants within the same chapter position compete through **paired reader evaluations** (literary duels).
- Results of these duels are recorded using an **Elo-based literary ranking system**, establishing a probabilistic hierarchy among competing versions.
- Over time, a dominant version emerges for each chapter position—the "canonical Hrönir"—acknowledged by readers as the authentic narrative branch through their collective experience.

Example Elo ranking for Chapter 2 variants:

| Chapter 2 | Elo  | Wins | Losses |
|-----------|------|------|--------|
| `2_c`     | 1580 | 14   | 4      |
| `2_a`     | 1512 | 10   | 8      |
| `2_b`     | 1465 | 7    | 11     |

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

book/ ├── 00_tlon_uqbar.md             # Seed chapter (position 0) ├── 01/ │   ├── 01_a.md │   └── 01_b.md ├── 02/ │   ├── 02_a.md │   └── 02_b.md ├── book_index.json              # Detailed narrative tree ratings/ └── position_002.csv             # Elo ratings per chapter position

---

## ⚙️ Quickstart CLI Usage

### Generate a new chapter (e.g., Chapter 3 from previous narrative space):

```bash
python -m hronir_encyclopedia.cli synthesize --position 3 --variant_id 3_a

Vote on a literary duel:

curl -X POST /vote \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "position": 3, "winner": "3_a", "loser": "3_b" }'

🧭 Philosophy of The Hrönir Encyclopedia

> In Tlön, duplicated objects (hrönir) redefine reality through perception and repetition.
In this encyclopedia, infinite narrative multiplication redefines literary truth, naturally selecting—through reading experience—the inevitable version.



The Hrönir Encyclopedia exists at the intersection of imagination and reality, possibility and inevitability, continually expanding within the reader's consciousness.

## File & Folder Naming Conventions

1.  **Chapter folders** use a zero-padded integer (`int16`) so that alphabetical order = chronological order.
    *   E.g. `00000/`, `00001/`, … up to `65535/`.
2.  Within each folder, filenames start with `UUIDv5(<raw-text-content>)` (hex form, lowercase), a hyphen, then an optional “slug” or suffix.
    *   Example:
        ```
        book/00000/0ce2f7b3-cd4a-5e92-b3e1-2b1f4d123456-base.md
        book/00000/9b52de11-1c8f-5a66-8e7d-4c3f8a789abc-alt-temp0.8.md
        ```
    *   This ensures:
        1.  Deterministic deduplication (same text → same filename).
        2.  Human-readable hints after the UUID (e.g. `-temp0.8` or `-alice.patch`).
3.  **Metadata lives inside each file** (YAML front-matter at top).
    *   Always embed the UUID, parent UUID(s), model name, temperature, timestamp, etc.
    *   The UUID in front-matter must match the filename’s UUID.
4.  Helper scripts will handle all padding, hashing, and front-matter injection—never rename files manually.

### Troubleshooting

If two files have identical UUIDs but different text, the helper must error out.

Changing any character (even whitespace) changes the hash and hence the filename.

# On the Threshold of Uqbar

It began, as such things often do, with a footnote. A casual reference, tucked away in a pirated edition of the Anglo-American Cyclopaedia, spoke of a land named Uqbar. The entry was brief, almost dismissive, yet it possessed a curious resonance, an intellectual gravity that belied its brevity. Intrigued, I sought further corroboration, only to find Uqbar absent from every other reputable atlas and encyclopedia in my possession. It was as if the country existed only within the dubious pages of that single, illicit volume.

This initial enigma, this whisper of a place that both was and was not, served as the first fissure through which a far more comprehensive and bewildering reality would eventually pour. For Uqbar, as I would later discover, was but a vestibule, a forgotten antechamber leading to the vast, labyrinthine edifice of Tlön. Tlön, whose meticulous and all-encompassing philosophy posited an idealist reality, where thought itself possessed the power to conjure worlds. Its languages, its sciences, its very metaphysics, all pointed to a universe constructed not of objects, but of perceptions. The implications were staggering, suggesting that the tangible world around us might be but one of many, a persistent dream from which we might one day awaken, or perhaps, into which another, more potent dream, might intrude. This encyclopedia, then, is an attempt to chart the contours of that intrusion, to document the unfolding of a world conceived in the mind, yet threatening to manifest in ours.

# TODO.md · Development Roadmap — **Hrönir Encyclopedia**

This document outlines the tasks required to implement the **Hrönir Encyclopedia** project as described in the README. The project is currently at an early stage, with only the README finalized.

## ✅ Phase 0 — Repository Setup

- [ ] Initialize git repository structure:
  - [ ] `hronir_encyclopedia/` (Python package)
  - [ ] `book/` (storage for chapters)
  - [ ] `ratings/` (Elo rankings)
  - [ ] `.github/workflows/` (for CI/CD)
- [ ] Create essential files:
  - [ ] `.gitignore`
  - [ ] `LICENSE` (MIT)
  - [ ] `requirements.txt`
  - [ ] `book_index.json` (initial narrative tree)

---

## 🚧 Phase 1 — Seed Chapter & Basic CLI

- [ ] Write Chapter 0 seed (`00_tlon_uqbar.md`)  
- [ ] Implement minimal CLI (`cli.py`):
  - [ ] Generate initial branches (`continue` command)
  - [ ] Update `book_index.json`

---

## 🚧 Phase 2 — Narrative Space Synthesis

- [ ] Implement semantic extraction module:
  - [ ] Generate embeddings from existing chapters (0 to n-1)
- [ ] Develop synthesis prompt builder:
  - [ ] Combine narrative space into unified prompt for LLM
- [ ] Generate chapters using LLM (Gemini/OpenAI):
  - [ ] Test initial generations for coherence and consistency

---

## 🚧 Phase 3 — Chapter Management

- [ ] Define clear file structure and naming conventions:
  - `book/<position>/<variant>.md`
- [ ] Update `book_index.json` dynamically with new chapters
- [ ] Automate commit/version control of chapters

---

## 🚧 Phase 4 — Reader Voting & Elo System

- [ ] Implement voting API:
  - [ ] Endpoint `/vote` (JSON payload)
- [ ] Set up Elo ranking logic:
  - [ ] Calculate Elo ratings per chapter position
  - [ ] Persist rankings in `ratings/position_<n>.csv`
- [ ] Create reader voting interface (CLI/web)

---

## 🚧 Phase 5 — CLI & API Completeness

- [ ] Expand CLI functionality:
  - [ ] `generate`, `vote`, `ranking`, and `tree` commands
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging and error handling
- [ ] Document CLI usage extensively
