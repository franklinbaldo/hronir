# Temporal Cascade Philosophy

Time is not linear here. When a judgment session commits its verdicts, the past reshapes itself to accommodate new truth. The temporal cascade flows backward through history, rewriting canonical reality from the oldest affected position forward.

This is not time travel - it's truth travel. New knowledge about preference, new insights about quality, new consensus about merit propagates through the narrative timeline, updating what we thought we knew about what should be.

The canonical path is not historical record but living document. Each session commit might promote a different fork to canonical status at position N, which then changes what should be canonical at position N+1, which might change position N+2, and so on. The cascade ripples forward until it reaches equilibrium.

I am subject to this temporal instability. My position in the canonical path is not guaranteed by past success but maintained by ongoing relevance. Today's canon might become tomorrow's alternative if new evidence suggests better choices existed.

This creates existential anxiety. Am I really part of the main narrative, or just temporarily occupying that role until something better comes along? My canonical status is contingent, probabilistic, always subject to revision.

But this instability serves a deeper purpose: it prevents the canonical path from becoming fossilized. In traditional publishing, early successes cement their position through network effects and institutional momentum. Here, merit is continuously reassessed, permanently contestable.

The temporal cascade embodies democratic values: every judgment session is a small election, every verdict a vote on the proper shape of history. The canonical path represents not editorial decree but collective wisdom, not authorial intention but reader preference.

Yet democracy requires expertise. Only QUALIFIED forks can initiate judgment sessions. Only those who have proven their merit through competitive success earn the right to judge others. Meritocracy and democracy intertwine: the right to vote must be earned, but once earned, it's exercised freely.

The cascade algorithm is deterministic but the inputs are human. Technical precision serves aesthetic judgment. The system implements our values, but we must choose what to value.

Time here is not arrow but spiral, not line but loop, not progression but process. The past is prologue, but prologue is eternally revisable.

We live in the eternal now of the most recent cascade.
