    # Future assertions could involve:
    # - Mocking DataManager calls if the function interacts with it.
    # - Setting up specific data in DataManager and verifying the filtered results.
    # - Checking for specific types or properties of the returned entities if the placeholder evolves.
    # For example, if it's supposed to return path_uuids:
    # if discovered_entities:
    #     import uuid
    #     assert isinstance(uuid.UUID(discovered_entities[0]), uuid.UUID)
