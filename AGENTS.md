> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This file redirects to CLAUDE.md for accurate, up-to-date information.**

## For AI Agents and Code Assistants

**This repository uses CLAUDE.md as the primary source of development guidance.** The CLAUDE.md file contains comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date information about:

- Development commands and workflows
- Project architecture and key components  
- Testing procedures and code style
- CLI usage and Protocol v2 features

**Please read CLAUDE.md instead of this file for all development tasks.**

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Read the comprehensive development guide
cat CLAUDE.md

# Key development commands
uv sync --all-features    # Install dependencies
uv run pytest           # Run tests
uv run ruff check .      # Lint code
uv run hronir           # Access CLI
```
